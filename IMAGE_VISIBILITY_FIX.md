# 🖼️ Image Visibility Fix

## Issue
Images were successfully uploading to Supabase Storage (`article-images` bucket haven shown in the dashboard), but they were not visible on the frontend blog post pages.

## Root Cause
**Column name mismatch between database and frontend:**

### Database Schema
- Stored image URL in column: `image_url`
- Stored excerpt in column: `excerpt`

### Frontend Code
- Expected image URL in field: `article.featured_image` 
- Expected excerpt in field: `article.teaser`

When the frontend tried to access `article.featured_image`, it got `undefined` because the database returned `image_url` instead.

## Solution
Added data transformation mapping in the query functions to convert database column names to frontend-friendly names.

### Files Fixed

#### 1. Home Page (`app/page.tsx`)
**Added mapping in `getPublishedArticles()` function:**

```typescript
// Map database column names to frontend-friendly names
return (data || []).map(article => ({
  ...article,
  featured_image: article.image_url,
  teaser: article.excerpt,
}));
```

#### 2. Article Detail Page (`app/article/[id]/page.tsx`)
**Added mapping in `getArticle()` function:**

```typescript
// Map database column names to frontend-friendly names
return {
  ...data,
  featured_image: data.image_url,
  teaser: data.excerpt,
};
```

#### 3. Admin Get Article API (`app/api/admin/articles/[id]/route.ts`)
**Added mapping in GET handler:**

```typescript
// Map database column names to frontend-friendly names
const mappedData = {
  ...data,
  featured_image: data.image_url,
  teaser: data.excerpt,
};

return NextResponse.json(mappedData);
```

## How It Works

### Data Flow

1. **Upload** → Frontend sends `featured_image` → API stores in `image_url` column
2. **Retrieve** → Database returns `image_url` → Transform to `featured_image` → Frontend displays it

### Mapping Transformation
```typescript
Database → Frontend
image_url → featured_image
excerpt   → teaser
```

## Testing

After this fix, images should now be visible:
- ✅ On the homepage article cards
- ✅ On the article detail page  
- ✅ In the admin edit page
- ✅ All throughout the blog

## Summary

✅ Images are now properly mapped from database to frontend  
✅ No changes needed to database schema  
✅ No changes needed to frontend components  
✅ Backward compatible approach - both column names work  
✅ Images uploaded to Supabase Storage will now display correctly

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Can't Find "Boost Blog Engagement" Workflow?

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're on the **Actions** tab
2. Check left sidebar - workflows are listed there
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Verify the file exists: `.github/workflows/cron-engagement.yml`

### Workflow Shows Red ‚ùå (Failed)

**Check the logs:**
1. Click on the failed run
2. Expand "Call Engagement Boost API" step
3. Look for error messages:

**Common errors:**
- **401 Unauthorized**: Check `CRON_SECRET` matches exactly
- **Could not resolve host**: Check `VERCEL_DOMAIN` is correct (no https://)
- **404 Not Found**: Check domain is correct and API route exists

### Secrets Not Found

**Fix:**
1. Go to: Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Verify both secrets exist:
   - `CRON_SECRET`
   - `VERCEL_DOMAIN`
3. Check they're spelled exactly (case-sensitive)

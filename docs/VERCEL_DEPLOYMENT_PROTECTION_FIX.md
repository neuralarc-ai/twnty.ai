# ðŸ”’ Fix Vercel Deployment Protection for Cron Jobs

## The Problem

Your Vercel deployment has **Deployment Protection** enabled, which blocks API calls with a 401 authentication page. This happens BEFORE your API route even receives the request.

## âœ… Solution Options

### Option 1: Disable Deployment Protection (Recommended for Cron)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard** â†’ Your Project
2. Click **Settings** â†’ **Deployment Protection**
3. **Disable Protection** or set it to "None"
4. Save changes

**Note**: This makes your deployment publicly accessible, which is fine for a blog.

### Option 2: Use Protection Bypass Token

If you want to keep protection enabled, you need to add a bypass token:

1. **Get bypass token**:
   - Vercel Dashboard â†’ Project â†’ Settings â†’ Deployment Protection
   - Look for "Bypass Token" or "Automation Bypass Token"
   - Copy the token

2. **Add to GitHub Secrets**:
   - GitHub â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets â†’ Actions
   - Add new secret: `VERCEL_BYPASS_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your bypass token

3. **Update the workflow** (I'll do this for you)

### Option 3: Make API Route Public

If using Preview Deployments protection, ensure your production deployment doesn't have protection, or whitelist the `/api/cron/boost-engagement` path.

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Fix (Recommended)

**Just disable Deployment Protection**:
- Vercel Dashboard â†’ Project â†’ Settings â†’ Deployment Protection â†’ Disable
- Run the workflow again - it should work immediately!

## Why This Happened

Vercel Deployment Protection is designed to prevent unauthorized access during preview deployments or before going live. However, it also blocks automated API calls (like from cron jobs) unless you use a bypass token or disable it.

For a production blog with proper authentication on the API endpoint itself (via CRON_SECRET), it's safe to disable deployment protection.

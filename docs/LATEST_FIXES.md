# ✅ Latest Fixes Applied - October 28, 2025

## 🎯 Three Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Logo Updated to Dark Black Typography
**Problem:** Logo had background and was overlapping content
**Solution:**
- Removed PNG image logo
- Replaced with pure text-based logo: "twnty.ai"
- Used dark black color (#000000)
- Applied Georgia serif font for professional look
- Removed any background elements
- Ensured proper spacing to prevent content overlap

**Result:** Clean, minimal logo that matches your design aesthetic perfectly

### 2. ✅ AI Content Generation - Clean Text Only
**Problem:** AI-generated articles contained markdown syntax (**, ___, ---, ***)
**Solution:**
- Updated Gemini API prompt with explicit instructions
- Added "DO NOT use any markdown syntax" directive
- Specified "Write everything as flowing prose with proper paragraphs"
- Ensured output is plain text format only
- Maintained natural paragraph breaks for readability

**Result:** All new AI-generated articles will be clean, well-formatted text without any markdown symbols

### 3. ✅ About Page Content Display Fixed
**Problem:** Author information was not showing on the About page
**Solution:**
- Identified database column mismatch
- Database uses: `name` and `bio`
- Code was looking for: `title` and `description`
- Updated About page component to use correct column names
- Verified author data exists in database

**Current Author Data:**
- Name: Aniket Tapre
- Bio: "Aniket Tapre is a serial entrepreneur and innovation strategist building Neural Arc and Helium AI. He writes about artificial intelligence, design thinking, and the future of human-machine collaboration."

**Result:** About page now displays author information correctly

# Automated Engagement Boost Setup

## ðŸ¤– Automatic Likes & Views Increase

Your blog includes an automated system that increases engagement metrics every 2 hours:
- **Likes**: Randomly increases by 6-10 per article
- **Views**: Randomly increases by 100-430 per article

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### Option 1: Vercel Cron Jobs (Recommended for Vercel Deployment)

1. Create `vercel.json` in your project root:
```json
{
  "crons": [{
    "path": "/api/cron/boost-engagement",
    "schedule": "0 */2 * * *"
  }]
}
```

2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Cron job will run automatically every 2 hours

### Option 2: External Cron Service (For Any Hosting)

1. Go to **cron-job.org** or **EasyCron.com**
2. Create a new cron job:
   - **URL**: `https://your-domain.com/api/cron/boost-engagement`
   - **Schedule**: Every 2 hours (`0 */2 * * *`)
   - **Method**: GET
   - **Headers**: Add `Authorization: Bearer your-cron-secret-key`

3. Your cron secret is in `.env.local`:
   ```
   CRON_SECRET=twnty-blog-cron-secret-2025
   ```

### Option 3: GitHub Actions (For GitHub Hosting)

1. Create `.github/workflows/engagement-boost.yml`:
```yaml
name: Boost Engagement
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 */2 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  boost:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Call Engagement Boost API
        run: |
          curl -X GET \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }}" \
            https://your-domain.com/api/cron/boost-engagement
```

2. Add `CRON_SECRET` to GitHub Secrets

### Testing the Cron Job

Test manually by calling:
```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer twnty-blog-cron-secret-2025" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/cron/boost-engagement
```

## ðŸ“Š How It Works

1. Every 2 hours, the cron job runs
2. Fetches all published articles
3. For each article:
   - Adds 6-10 random likes
   - Adds 100-430 random views
4. Updates the database
5. Returns success status

## ðŸ”’ Security

- The endpoint requires an Authorization header with your secret key
- Only published articles are affected
- Changes are logged in the response

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring

Check the cron job logs to see:
- Number of articles updated
- Total likes and views added
- Any errors or issues

**Note**: Make sure to set up the cron job after deploying your blog to production!
